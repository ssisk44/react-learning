### Video 1 Notes - Beginner Tutorial
> **Public Folder** - not bundled during final output (general url based)
> **Asset Folder** - is bundled during final output 

### Video 2 Notes - Card Components


### Video 3 Notes - CSS Styles
> **External** - CSS contained in a seperate file and imported

> **Modular** - component based styles grouped in a folder (x.module.css w/ component), global styles are tough

> **Inline** - good for small,minimally styled components... can make code difficult to read

### Video 4 Notes - Props
> **Props** - <ins>read-only</ins> properties that are shared between components. A parent component can send data to a child component.<br/> ex. '\<Component key="value">'
>

> **Prop Types** - a mechanism that ensures that the passed balue is of the correct datatype. <br/> ex. age: PropTypes.number <br/> It is good practice to include PropTypes with any props

> **Default Props** - default value for props in case they are not passed from the parent component

> **Conditional Rendering** - allows you to control what gets rendered in your application based on certain conditions (show, hide, or change components)
